/// This class represents an actual server that listens for requests on a specific port. Each request
/// specifies a command to execute and a list of arguments for this command. The command's output
/// is then sent as a response back to the client.
///
/// The server has a white list of commands to execute (see @c IETelnetServerConfiguration) and
/// will return an error when processing a request to execute a command not from this list.
///
/// Internally, this server uses Apple's QServer from RemoteCurrency sample project which provides
/// a high-level foundation for building a TCP server that supports IPv4/IPv6 and Bonjour discovery.
